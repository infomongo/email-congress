	"""
	I'm writing today to urge you to vote no on the 'skinny repeal' healthcare bill.
	
	If the bill passes it will do significant harm to Coloradans. I'm worried that the house will pass the bill unchanged, even though this is mostly a political tactic to take the bill into committee.
	
	This is a bad bill. You have already voted for 'repeal and replace' and straight repeal. You can convincingly claim to have fought to repeal Obamacare. This is not repeal. This is Obamacare light.
	
	Do the right things for Colorado. Show some leadership and act like an adult. The right thing to do at this point is to fix the flaws in Obamacare.
	"""
	
	And I pause for "2" seconds
	
	When I click "Submit"

	Then the page should contain "Thank You"
