	I'm writing today to urge you to vote no on the 'skinny repeal' healthcare bill.
	
	It seems like the senate is trying to use this bill as an sort of "end run" around the process. The idea is that this bill will pass and then there will be a conference with the house.
	
	This is a bad idea, for several reasons. 1) The house could pass the bill as is an send it to the president. 2) In conference, if no alternate agreement is reached, then the bill will be sent to the President. 3) If a small group of representatives want the bill to pass, all they need to do is block progress on alternatives.
	
	So please, only vote for the 'skinny repeal' if you are happy passing it. Becuase it will become likely to pass if the senate votes for it.
	
	Wouldn't it be better to slow down, and work on a replacement or an improved version of the bill in a more orderly fashion?

	And I pause for "2" seconds
	
	When I click "Submit"

	Then the page should contain "Thank You"
